# Dev Daily (CS Job Search Tracker)
CS majors have it rough right now, especially in this market. This tracker helps you stay consistent by logging what you did each day and showing whether you hit your goals.
## What it does
- Set **daily goals** for:
  1. Number of job applications filled
  2. LeetCode problems solved
  3. Time spent on personal projects
- Fill out a quick daily form
- Submit one entry per day
- See entries as color-coded cards:
  - Green = goals met
  - Yellow = partially met
  - Red = missed
## To-Do
- Change schema.prisma to match the daily goals (should be just posts I think)
- Create new entry creation form with sliders
- Handle entry creation with server actions
- TBD...
